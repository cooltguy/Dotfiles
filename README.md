# Tesqie's Dotfiles

Here are all the config files I use for my Linux installation.

## Programs Used

* Shell: zsh
* WM: bspwm
* Editor: vim
* Panel: polybar
* Terminal: Alacritty

### Notes 

* For most of the system, I use [Inconsolata](https://www.1001fonts.com/inconsolata-font.html), You should probably download that if you want to use these files!
* The Polybar color theme was made manually from taking the color scheme from my wallpaper. Change it to whatever you see fit.
* I use scrot for screenshots and betterscreenlock for bspwm
* For bspwm, I also use pidswallow to manage window swallowing.
* Any scripts that aren't by myself with have a link to them commented in the files themselves.
